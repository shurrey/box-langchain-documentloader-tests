    "# Using the Box File Search Tool with your LangGraph agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we will show a simple example of using the BoxFileSearchTool with OpenAI and LangGraph as an agent. This is a simple use case so we can focus on getting it up and running quickly, but the sky's the limit. With this tool you can easily use full text search to find and retrieve text from documents stored in [Box](https://box.com) to augment your AI workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will need a Box instance, but don't worry, we have you covered. You can sign up for a free Developer Account [here](https://account.box.com/signup/n/developer#ty9l3). Once you are signed up, you'll need to [create your Box app](https://cloud.app.box.com/developers/console) and [enable it in your admin console](https://developer.box.com/guides/authorization/custom-app-approval/) to follow along. Remember when following the steps in enabling in the admin console, with the free developer account, you are the admin! And don't worry, if you need help, you can all our developer documentation [here](https://developer.box.com), or find us on the [community site](https://forum.box.com) where we are always happy to help. \n",
    "\n",
    "With all that out of the way, let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might imagine, Both Box and OpenAI require authentication to access data through the APIs. As such, you will need both your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and your `BOX_DEVELOPER_TOKEN` to follow along. When you created your Box app, you had to choose an authentication type. Whether you chose Oauth2, JWT, or CCG, you will have access to a developer token. These are meant for development and not production. For this reason, these tokens are only valid for one hour. In the Developer Console, click into the app you created, navigate to the `Configuration` tab, and you should see a section dedicated to the Developer Token and either a button to `Generate Developer Token` or you will see a field with the token. If you see a token there, I'd recommend revoking that token and creating a new one unless you either generated it your self in the last hour or are sharing that app with another developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have your OpenAI API key and you Box Developer Token, let's use getpass to add them to your environment."

    "## Let's start the fun stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have that out of the way, let's dive in and test the BoxFileSearchTool to see what it does. When I wrote this, I was testing with a script I downloaded from the interwebs and my `box_search_query` is one of the first lines in the script. You will need to upload some files to test with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Box search functionality in general, and by proxy, the search API implementation, is a full text search, which runs against the fully-indexed content that you have permission to view in your Box instance. As such, if your search query is vague, you might end up with a lot of results. Searching for a line in a script is a little pedantic, but I recommend running this script a few times to get a sense for the search query that will return the results you are looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in this script is to instantiate the BoxFileSearchTool. We are using environment variables to store the Developer Token, but if you were using something like python_dotenv, you can also pass the token: `box_search = BoxFileSearchTool(box_developer_token=\"your_token\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to illustrate what the tool returns -- spoiler alert, its a List of Document objects containing the text representation of all the files that match the search criteria -- and to help hone in on your search query to limit the Box data to only include what you want. "

She hesitantly calls over to him. He \\\\nacknowledges her with a lift of the chin. Making sure he \\\\nkeeps his distance from her, he looks around to see if \\\\nanyone is watching him. He tosses his head for her to \\\\nfollow. He begins to walk away down the block. She follows.\\\\n\\\\nHector is looking at Amanda. He appears to have run out of \\\\nthings to say.

They begin to \\\\ndance. No music can be heard. The sound of the girls\\\\\\' bodies \\\\nis our soundtrack. We hear their strained breathing, palms \\\\nand sneaker bottoms pounding while they hum and count softly \\\\nto themselves in an effort to keep the rhythm.\\\\n\\\\nSLO-MO: We explore the bodies of the dancers; their bright \\\\neyes and sweaty brows, their stomping feet and colliding \\\\nhands (dark side and light side). The younger girls perform \\\\nprovocative dance movements, the older girls repeat them.\\\\n\\\\nTheir bodies silhouette in the bright sunlight.\\\\n\\\\nCUT TO: TITLES\\\\n\\\\nEXT. AMANDA\\\\\\'S BLOCK - DAY \\\\n\\\\nAMANDA, a tall 14-year-old exits the front door of her \\\\napartment budding with her headphones in one hand and a \\\\nmagazine in the other. She sits down on her stoop, puts her \\\\nheadphones on and presses \"play\". We can hear the sound of \\\\nSalsa leaking out of the sides of her headphones. JENETTE, \\\\nten years old with big black hair in rubber-band restraints, sits on \\\\nthe sidewalk below Amanda drawing with a piece of chalk. Jenette \\\\n\\\\n        looks over her shoulder and sees Amanda reading her magazine Jenette \\\\nclimbs the stairs and sits down beside her.\\\\n\\\\nThe camera pans to reveal AARON, an 18-year-old boy on the \\\\nother side of the street, unloading some fireworks from the \\\\ntrunk of a car. He\\\\\\'s filling a paper bag with them, \\\\ncarefully making sure not to reveal what he\\\\\\'s doing to \\\\nonlookers.\\\\n\\\\nAt the ear end of the block, DONNA, 14, and MICHELLE, 12, \\\\nsit and watch Aaron at work.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3/20/23, 5:31 PM FIVE FEET AND RISING by Peter Sollett\\\\n\\\\nwww.dailyscript.com/scripts/fivefeetandrising.html 2/25\\\\n\\\\nMICHELLE \\\\nHow does he look up close?\\\\n\\\\nDONNA \\\\n(Amorously) \\\\n\\\\nUmm, he got dark brownish \\\\neyes, he got a nice nose I \\\\nlove his nose.

She hesitantly calls over to him. He \\\\nacknowledges her with a lift of the chin. Making sure he \\\\nkeeps his distance from her, he looks around to see if \\\\nanyone is watching him. He tosses his head for her to \\\\nfollow. He begins to walk away down the block. She follows.\\\\n\\\\nHector is looking at Amanda. He appears to have run out of \\\\nthings to say.
