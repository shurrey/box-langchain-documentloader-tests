They begin to \\ndance. No music can be heard. The sound of the girls\\' bodies \\nis our soundtrack. We hear their strained breathing, palms \\nand sneaker bottoms pounding while they hum and count softly \\nto themselves in an effort to keep the rhythm.\\n\\nSLO-MO: We explore the bodies of the dancers; their bright \\neyes and sweaty brows, their stomping feet and colliding \\nhands (dark side and light side). The younger girls perform \\nprovocative dance movements, the older girls repeat them.\\n\\nTheir bodies silhouette in the bright sunlight.\\n\\nCUT TO: TITLES\\n\\nEXT. AMANDA\\'S BLOCK - DAY \\n\\nAMANDA, a tall 14-year-old exits the front door of her \\napartment budding with her headphones in one hand and a \\nmagazine in the other. She sits down on her stoop, puts her \\nheadphones on and presses \"play\". We can hear the sound of \\nSalsa leaking out of the sides of her headphones. JENETTE, \\nten years old with big black hair in rubber-band restraints, sits on \\nthe sidewalk below Amanda drawing with a piece of chalk. Jenette \\n\\n        looks over her shoulder and sees Amanda reading her magazine Jenette \\nclimbs the stairs and sits down beside her.\\n\\nThe camera pans to reveal AARON, an 18-year-old boy on the \\nother side of the street, unloading some fireworks from the \\ntrunk of a car. He\\'s filling a paper bag with them, \\ncarefully making sure not to reveal what he\\'s doing to \\nonlookers.\\n\\nAt the ear end of the block, DONNA, 14, and MICHELLE, 12, \\nsit and watch Aaron at work.\\n\\n\\n\\n3/20/23, 5:31 PM FIVE FEET AND RISING by Peter Sollett\\n\\nwww.dailyscript.com/scripts/fivefeetandrising.html 2/25\\n\\nMICHELLE \\nHow does he look up close?\\n\\nDONNA \\n(Amorously) \\n\\nUmm, he got dark brownish \\neyes, he got a nice nose I \\nlove his nose.

She hesitantly calls over to him. He \\nacknowledges her with a lift of the chin. Making sure he \\nkeeps his distance from her, he looks around to see if \\nanyone is watching him. He tosses his head for her to \\nfollow. He begins to walk away down the block. She follows.\\n\\nHector is looking at Amanda. He appears to have run out of \\nthings to say. Amanda removes her headphones. Her music \\nbecomes clearer, more audible.\\n\\nHECTOR \\nYo, you gonna keep me \\nhangin\\' like dat?\\n\\nAMANDA \\nHector, Yo try to rap to me every day, why don\\'t you \\ntake your three-quarters retarded ass outta here?\\n\\nHECTOR \\nYo, you betta give me my \\nrespects or I\\'ll tell your \\nlittle girl ova here what \\nI heard about you and my \\nboy.\\n\\nAmanda puts her headphones back on.\\n\\nHECTOR looks like he got a new girl anyway.\\n\\nEXT. 8TH STREET BETWEEN AVENUES C AND D - AFTERNOON \\n\\nVICTOR, a skinny 12-year-old with sloppy hair, is asleep in \\nthe sun on his fire escape. There is sweat beaded up on his \\nbody. His shirt is rolled up behind his head like a pillow. \\nHis breath is heavy, his chest rises and falls. The camera \\ntilts to reveal CARLOS, ten, rounding the corner on the \\nstreet below. The camera tracks backwards as Carlos \\napproaches. He is talking to himself.\\n\\nCARLOS \\n(To himself) \\n\\nWhatcha gonna do when ya \\nbitch is untrue?\\n\\nCarlos lifts his head up to look at the fire escapes.\\n\\nCARLOS \\nYo Victor!\\n\\nThe camera pans and tilts up to the fire escapes.

They begin to \\\\ndance. No music can be heard. The sound of the girls\\\\\\' bodies \\\\nis our soundtrack. We hear their strained breathing, palms \\\\nand sneaker bottoms pounding while they hum and count softly \\\\nto themselves in an effort to keep the rhythm.\\\\n\\\\nSLO-MO: We explore the bodies of the dancers; their bright \\\\neyes and sweaty brows, their stomping feet and colliding \\\\nhands (dark side and light side). The younger girls perform \\\\nprovocative dance movements, the older girls repeat them.\\\\n\\\\nTheir bodies silhouette in the bright sunlight.\\\\n\\\\nCUT TO: TITLES\\\\n\\\\nEXT. AMANDA\\\\\\'S BLOCK - DAY \\\\n\\\\nAMANDA, a tall 14-year-old exits the front door of her \\\\napartment budding with her headphones in one hand and a \\\\nmagazine in the other.

JENETTE, \\\\nten years old with big black hair in rubber-band restraints, sits on \\\\nthe sidewalk below Amanda drawing with a piece of chalk. Jenette \\\\n\\\\n        looks over her shoulder and sees Amanda reading her magazine Jenette \\\\nclimbs the stairs and sits down beside her.\\\\n\\\\nThe camera pans to reveal AARON, an 18-year-old boy on the \\\\nother side of the street, unloading some fireworks from the \\\\ntrunk of a car. He\\\\\\'s filling a paper bag with them, \\\\ncarefully making sure not to reveal what he\\\\\\'s doing to \\\\nonlookers.\\\\n\\\\nAt the ear end of the block, DONNA, 14, and MICHELLE, 12, \\\\nsit and watch Aaron at work.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3/20/23, 5:31 PM FIVE FEET AND RISING by Peter Sollett\\\\n\\\\nwww.dailyscript.com/scripts/fivefeetandrising.html 2/25\\\\n\\\\nMICHELLE \\\\nHow does he look up close?\\\\n\\\\nDONNA \\\\n(Amorously) \\\\n\\\\nUmm, he got dark brownish \\\\neyes, he got a nice nose I \\\\nlove his nose.

She hesitantly calls over to him. He \\\\nacknowledges her with a lift of the chin. Making sure he \\\\nkeeps his distance from her, he looks around to see if \\\\nanyone is watching him. He tosses his head for her to \\\\nfollow. He begins to walk away down the block. She follows.\\\\n\\\\nHector is looking at Amanda. He appears to have run out of \\\\nthings to say.
